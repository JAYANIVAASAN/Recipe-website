            <h2>chicken rice</h2>
            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups of jasmine rice</li>
                <li>4 cups of chicken broth</li>
                <li>4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs or breasts</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1-inch piece of ginger, sliced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
                <li>Soy sauce, for serving</li>
                <li>Sliced cucumbers and tomatoes, for garnish (optional)</li>
                <li>Chili sauce or chili oil, for serving (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain well.</li>
                <li>In a large pot or rice cooker, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and ginger slices, and saut√© until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the rice to the pot and stir to coat with the garlic and ginger. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Pour in the chicken broth and season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
                <li>While the rice is cooking, season the chicken thighs or breasts with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>In a separate pan, heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces skin-side down and cook until golden brown, about 5-6 minutes. Flip the chicken and continue cooking until cooked through, about another 5-6 minutes. Remove from heat and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing.
                </li>
                <li>Once the rice is done, fluff it with a fork and serve alongside the sliced chicken. Garnish with sliced cucumbers and tomatoes if desired, and serve with soy sauce and chili sauce or chili oil on the side.</li>
