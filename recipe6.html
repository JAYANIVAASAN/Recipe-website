            <h2>ice cream</h2>
            <P><strong>Ingredients:</strong></P>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
                <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>Pinch of salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>4 ounces (about 120g) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
                <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, whole milk, sugar, salt, and cocoa powder. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it reaches a simmer. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped chocolate to the hot cream mixture and stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth. Slowly pour about 1/2 cup of the hot chocolate mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly to temper the eggs and prevent them from curdling.</li>
                <li>Gradually whisk the egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining chocolate mixture.</li>
                <li>Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens slightly and coats the back of a spoon, about 5-7 minutes. Do not let it boil.</li>
                <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl to remove any cooked egg bits.</li>
                <li>Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
                <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Chill the custard in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight until completely cold.</li>
                <li>Once the custard is chilled, churn it in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions until it reaches a soft-serve consistency, about 20-25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer the churned ice cream to an airtight container and freeze for at least 4 hours or until firm.</li>
                <li>Serve your homemade chocolate ice cream scooped into bowls or cones, or use it to make ice cream sandwiches, floats, or sundaes.</li>
