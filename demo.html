                <li>1 and 3/4 cups (220g) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3/4 cup (65g) unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>2 cups (400g) granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1 cup (240ml) whole milk, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 cup (240ml) boiling water</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>For the frosting:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup (230g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
                <li>3 and 1/2 cups (420g) powdered sugar, sifted</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (45g) unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/4 cup (60ml) heavy cream or milk</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Beat on medium speed with a hand mixer or in a stand mixer until well combined, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce the mixer speed to low and carefully add the boiling water to the cake batter. Beat on low speed until just combined. The batter will be thin, but that's okay.</li>
                <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                <li>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the frosting. In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Gradually add the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and salt to the butter, mixing on low speed until combined. Add the vanilla extract and heavy cream, then increase the mixer speed to medium-high and beat until the frosting is light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once the cakes are completely cooled, frost the top of one cake layer with a generous amount of frosting. Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting.</li>
                <li>Slice, serve, and enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate cake!</li>

                <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1-inch piece of ginger, sliced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
                <li>Soy sauce, for serving</li>
                <li>Sliced cucumbers and tomatoes, for garnish (optional)</li>
                <li>Chili sauce or chili oil, for serving (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

                <li>Add the rice to the pot and stir to coat with the garlic and ginger. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Pour in the chicken broth and season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef (preferably 80/20 lean to fat ratio)</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
                <li>Your choice of toppings: lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Divide the ground beef into four equal portions and gently shape each portion into a patty about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Press a slight indentation into the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent it from bulging while cooking. Season both sides of the patties generously with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Place the patties on the grill or grill pan and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium doneness, or until desired level of doneness is reached. Avoid pressing down on the patties with a spatula while they cook, as this can cause the juices to escape and result in a less juicy burger.</li>
                <li>Place the patties on the grill or grill pan and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium doneness, or until desired level of doneness is reached. Avoid pressing down on the patties with a spatula while they cook, as this can cause the juices to escape and result in a less juicy burger.</li>
                <li>Once the burgers are cooked to your liking, remove them from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>Assemble your burgers by placing the cooked patties on the bottom halves of the hamburger buns. Add your desired toppings, such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise</li>
                <li>Top with the remaining halves of the hamburger buns and serve immediately.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
                <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>Pinch of salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>4 ounces (about 120g) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
                <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, whole milk, sugar, salt, and cocoa powder. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it reaches a simmer. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped chocolate to the hot cream mixture and stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth. Slowly pour about 1/2 cup of the hot chocolate mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly to temper the eggs and prevent them from curdling.</li>
                <li>Gradually whisk the egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining chocolate mixture.</li>
                <li>Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens slightly and coats the back of a spoon, about 5-7 minutes. Do not let it boil.</li>
                <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl to remove any cooked egg bits.</li>
                <li>Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
                <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Chill the custard in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight until completely cold.</li>
                <li>Once the custard is chilled, churn it in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions until it reaches a soft-serve consistency, about 20-25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer the churned ice cream to an airtight container and freeze for at least 4 hours or until firm.</li>
                <li>Serve your homemade chocolate ice cream scooped into bowls or cones, or use it to make ice cream sandwiches, floats, or sundaes.</li>
