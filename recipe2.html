                <li>1 cup (240ml) whole milk, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 cup (240ml) boiling water</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>For the frosting:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup (230g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
                <li>3 and 1/2 cups (420g) powdered sugar, sifted</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (45g) unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/4 cup (60ml) heavy cream or milk</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Beat on medium speed with a hand mixer or in a stand mixer until well combined, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce the mixer speed to low and carefully add the boiling water to the cake batter. Beat on low speed until just combined. The batter will be thin, but that's okay.</li>
                <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                <li>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the frosting. In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Gradually add the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and salt to the butter, mixing on low speed until combined. Add the vanilla extract and heavy cream, then increase the mixer speed to medium-high and beat until the frosting is light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once the cakes are completely cooled, frost the top of one cake layer with a generous amount of frosting. Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting.</li>
                <li>Slice, serve, and enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate cake!</li>
