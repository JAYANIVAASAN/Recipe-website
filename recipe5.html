            <h2>burger</h2>
            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef (preferably 80/20 lean to fat ratio)</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
                <li>Your choice of toppings: lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Divide the ground beef into four equal portions and gently shape each portion into a patty about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Press a slight indentation into the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent it from bulging while cooking. Season both sides of the patties generously with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Place the patties on the grill or grill pan and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium doneness, or until desired level of doneness is reached. Avoid pressing down on the patties with a spatula while they cook, as this can cause the juices to escape and result in a less juicy burger.</li>
                <li>Place the patties on the grill or grill pan and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium doneness, or until desired level of doneness is reached. Avoid pressing down on the patties with a spatula while they cook, as this can cause the juices to escape and result in a less juicy burger.</li>
                <li>Once the burgers are cooked to your liking, remove them from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>Assemble your burgers by placing the cooked patties on the bottom halves of the hamburger buns. Add your desired toppings, such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise</li>
                <li>Top with the remaining halves of the hamburger buns and serve immediately.</li>
